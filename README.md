# 🗺️ National Parks Roadtrip Map Tool

A collaborative project between TripleTen Data Science and Software Engineering students focused on developing an online tool to plan a vacation to United States National Parks based on their location, activities, and amenities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, functional MVP that:
- Accepts location-based input (e.g., addresses, coordinates)
- Applies a route optimization algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra, A*, Genetic Algorithm)
- Outputs the most efficient route based on selected criteria (e.g., shortest time, least distance)

This tool could serve use cases in delivery services, travel planning, field technician routing, or logistics.

## 📦 Features (Planned)

- [ ] Clean and modular backend structure
- [ ] Basic frontend interface or API endpoint
- [ ] Input support: manual entry or uploaded data (e.g., CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Route optimization algorithm (TBD)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and testing

## 🧠 Technologies

- Programming Language: `Python` / `JavaScript` / `Node.js` *(decide based on group skillset)*
- Algorithm: Dijkstra / A* / Simulated Annealing / Custom Heuristic

## 📝 Notes

- Algorithm selection and trade-offs will be discussed as a group.
- Aim to build something that *works*, then iterate and optimize.
- Keep code modular and readable for team collaboration.
